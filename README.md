# BasicGame-on-Gradle

jMonkeyEngine's prototypical `BasicGame` as a Gradle project

If you want to get started using Gradle with jMonkeyEngine's IDE (or with
NetBeans) and don't know where to start, use this project as a template.

You will need the "Gradle Support" plugin.
Download and install it using the Plugins dialog in the IDE
(Menu bar -> "Tools" -> "Plugins") before proceeding.
If this plugin isn't shown in the IDE's "Plugins" tool,
you can download it from
[GitHub](https://github.com/kelemen/netbeans-gradle-project/releases).

### Clone the BasicGame-on-Gradle repository using Git:

 1. Open the "Clone Repository" wizard in the IDE, either:
     + Menu bar -> "Team" -> "Git" -> "Clone..." or
     + Menu bar -> "Team" -> "Remote" -> "Clone..."
 2. For "Repository URL:" specify
    "https://github.com/stephengold/BasicGame-on-Gradle.git" (without the quotes).
 3. Clear the "User:" and "Password:" text boxes.
 4. For "Clone into:" specify a writable folder (on a local filesystem)
    that doesn't already contain "BasicGame-on-Gradle".
 5. Click on the "Next >" button.
 6. Make sure the "master" remote branch is checked.
 7. Click on the "Next >" button again.
 8. Make sure the Checkout Branch is set to "master".
 9. Make sure the "Scan for NetBeans Projects after Clone" box is checked.
10. Click on the "Finish" button.
11. When the "Clone Completed" dialog appears, click on the "Open Project..."
    button.

### Run the project

    right-click on the "BasicGame-on-Gradle" project to select it.
 2. Select "Run".
